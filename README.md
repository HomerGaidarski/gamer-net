# Workflow Instructions
1. Find issue assigned to you
2. Create a branch **from the master branch** where the issue number is the name of the branch
3. Clone newly created branch to desktop
4. Make changes on desktop until issue resolved
5. **Pull changes one last time** from the master branch and merge to make sure it still works with your new code
6. **Create a Pull Request** into the master branch and **mention the issue number resolved**

**The Build Meister completes the rest by testing then merging the pull requesting. If the pull request is successfully imported and resolves the issue, the Build Meister will close the issue.**
